[-] fusgd: segfault still exists
	syslog: fusgd[23144]: segfault at 0 ip 00007f0447c8b646 sp 00007ffebe6f37f8 error 4 in libc-2.27.so[7f0447bda000+1e7000]
	fix: enable core dump and analyse it.

[-] fusgd: does not properly consider syscall parameters and therefore fails do determine absolute file paths.
    Reproduce: `/bin/rm` -r or `/bin/find`
    Guess: First parameter of openat() is currently not considered
           which would result in exactly this kind of errors.
    Fix: Write parser functions which interpret syscall parameters properly
         and consider their return values (success or error). Unsuccessful 
         attempts probably don't have to be recorded.
