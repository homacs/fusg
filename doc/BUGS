[-] fusgd segfaults sometimes. 
    Can be observed in syslog (or dmesg).
    message: fusgd[19129]: segfault at 0 ip 00007fbe455b2646 sp 00007fffbe5d7628 error 4 in libc-2.27.so[7fbe45501000+1e7000]
    Always with the exact same syslog message.
    Reproduce: Just let it run for a while.
    Fix: Setup system to store core dumps of daemons somewhere reasonable,
              so I can analyse it with gdb.

[-] fusgd does not properly consider syscall parameters and therefore fails do determine absolute file paths.
    Reproduce: `/bin/rm` -r or `/bin/find`
    Guess: First parameter of openat() is currently not considered
           which would result in exactly this kind of errors.
    Fix: Write parser functions which interpret syscall parameters properly
         and consider their return values (success or error). Unsuccessful 
         attempts probably don't have to be recorded.
