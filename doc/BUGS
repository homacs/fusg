[-] fusgd: There are lots of incomplete events coming from
	audispd (only those with PATH record are actually noted as
	such by fusgd). Many events have missing records such as CWD, 
	PATH and other record types. This has been seen in several
	cases regardless of the type of event, success of
	associated syscall or whether files exist or not (realpath).
	It is possible, that audispd or even auditd just misses 
	incoming messages, but that has to be further analysed.

[-] fusgd: does not properly consider syscall parameters and therefore 
	       fails do determine absolute file paths.
    Reproduce: `/bin/rm` -r or `/bin/find`
    Guess: First parameter of openat() is currently not considered
           which would result in exactly this kind of errors.
    Fix: Write parser functions which interpret syscall parameters properly
         and consider their return values (success or error). Unsuccessful 
         attempts probably don't have to be recorded.

[-] fusg: is still incomplete. Most notably: fusg does not consider soft- 
    and hard links properly and thus will not list all entries referring
    to the same inode entry.
