USAGE:

    fusg -h
 
will tell you more.



INSTALLATION


Simply copy the executable to some suitable location.

By default, it expects a configuration in

    /etc/fusg/fusg.conf

Use argument -c to provide a different location.

You've got an example conf file with the sources 
(see fusg/etc). See FUSGD_README for more info on that.

The command line tool fusg, cannot access the data base
unless

   1. It is owned by root
      > sudo fusg /usr/local/bin/fusg
   2. The setuid bit is set
      > sudo chmod +s /usr/local/bin/fusg
