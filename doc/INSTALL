INSTALLATION
------------


After BUILD!


Copy executables *fusg* and *fusgd* to an appropriate location such as this:

> sudo cp ./Release/fusgd /sbin/fusgd
> sudo cp ./Release/fusg  /usr/local/bin/fusg
> sudo chmod +s  /usr/local/bin/fusg

Executables fusg and fusgd have to be owned by root
and the command line tool has to have the setuid
bit set (therefore chmod +s).

They will also need a config file, usually to be 
found in 

    /etc/fusg/fusg.conf 
    
You can specify another location with parameter 
-c or --conf (accepted by both).

You've got an example conf file with the sources 
(see ../etc/fusg.conf). This one has been configured for
debugging purposes and will create files in /tmp
only. It contains documentation (see there).

Next, copy the configuration of the plugin (fusgd) into the 
plugin.d folder of audispd.
NOTE: Location of the folder can differ, see man audispd.conf.

> sudo cp ../etc/audisp/plugin.d/fusgd.conf /etc/audisp/plugin.d/fusgd.conf

Review the configuration of auditd and make sure, audispd is actually 
active.

> sudo vi /etc/audit/auditd.conf

  Must contain the following line:
  
  dispatcher = /sbin/audispd
  

Finally restart auditd to make changes happen.

> sudo systemctl restart auditd
